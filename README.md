# House-price-estimation
The project's goal is to assess how well two well-known machine learning algorithms, multiple linear regression, and XGBoost Regressor, estimate the price at which a house will sell. To carry out this project, a dataset of past real estate transactions will be gathered, and key features such as the property's location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and additional amenities will be identified for analysis. The data will be preprocessed, cleaned, and transformed to prepare it for modeling. Using the same dataset, the multiple linear regression and XGBoost Regressor methods are developed and trained, and their performance is assessed using a variety of measures, including accuracy, cross-validation, mean squared error, and root mean squared error. The ultimate goal of the project is to determine which algorithm produces more accurate and reliable predictions and can be used to build an effective Project.

CONCLUSION  
This project serves as a significant example of applying machine learning techniques in the real estate sector. Through the use of algorithms like multiple linear regression and XGBoost, we can make precise predictions about the sale price of a property based on a range of relevant features. This prediction are useful for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions about pricing and selling houses. The results of this project are useful for various stakeholders in the real estate industry. Buyers can use this Project to make informed decisions about purchasing a property, while sellers can use it to price their property correctly and sell it quickly. Real estate professionals can use the estimator to advise their clients on pricing and selling strategies. In conclusion, this project is a worthy application of machine learning in the real estate.
