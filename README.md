# House-price-estimation
The project's goal is to assess how well two well-known machine learning algorithms, multiple linear regression, and XGBoost Regressor, estimate the price at which a house will sell. To carry out this project, a dataset of past real estate transactions will be gathered, and key features such as the property's location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and additional amenities will be identified for analysis. The data will be preprocessed, cleaned, and transformed to prepare it for modeling. Using the same dataset, the multiple linear regression and XGBoost Regressor methods are developed and trained, and their performance is assessed using a variety of measures, including accuracy, cross-validation, mean squared error, and root mean squared error. The ultimate goal of the project is to determine which algorithm produces more accurate and reliable predictions and can be used to build an effective Project.
